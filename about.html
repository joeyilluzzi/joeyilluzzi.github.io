							<h1>About the Project and Author.</h1>
                            <h3>Project</h3>
                            <p>This project was created as part of the 2019 Digital Humanities Summer Scholar (DHSS) program ran by Skillman Library at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Although this project was researched and constructed independently, it would not be possible without the advice and guidance of my fellow DHS scholars and program director Angela Perkins.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Author</h3>
        
                            <p>Hello! My name is Joey Illuzzi and I am an undergraduate at Lafayette College double majoring in Policy Studies & Economics with a minor in Mandarin Chinese. I have been a fan of LoL eSports since around 2012 (still have my official signed poster from the original C9 roster hanging in my room) and have tried my best to follow every region along the way, but have realistically watched mostly LCS, LEC, and LCK (many 4 a.m. nights spent on Twitch). </p>
                            
                            <p>I wanted to create this project to provide a window into labor rights issues in LoL eSports for fans, non-fans, and players with the goals of increasing overall awareness and (hopefully) inspiring further research. I hope to continue expanding and updating this site in my free time.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Contact Info</h3>
                            
                            <p>If you have any questions about the project or would like to make an inquiry (personal or business), please feel free to email me at: joeyilluzzi@gmail.com.</p>
